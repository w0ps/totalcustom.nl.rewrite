this site is originally built to test and showcase hopcms,
a kind of static site generator, which loads files from disk and generates pages.
It is good for rapid prototyping, as images, css and js files are added automatically.
Recently I reworked a great deal of source code to allow hopcms to be a requireable npm module,
improving version control a lot.<br><br>

Also, as you may have seen already, it features somewhat over the top page transitions.
Rest assured that these can be picked, altered and expanded upon for each website that uses this system.
Tied in with the transitions is dynamic content loading, which starts downloading the new content as soon as
you hover over a link, in order to provide lightning-fast loading times.<br><br>

Included with the cms is a custom built lightbox, featuring a filmstrip and supporting custom intents,
such as the one included here, the ability to import the image viewed into the slidepuzzle game.<br><br>
