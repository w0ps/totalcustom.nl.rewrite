	<h3>SmartCanvas</h3>

	The scripts shown on this page all make use of the same parent framework, that is,
	they use an enhanced canvas element, I call it SmartCanvas.
	It has easy methods for drawing functions such as clearing,
	having background colors and trails. It draws objects in relative space
	and has a camera that can move around and zoom in and out,
	and sub-objects can have draw, step, click and hover functions applied to them.

	<h3>Subobjects</h3>

	While these snippets can be used in this smart canvas, they probably work in other contexts too.
	With no more adue, here's the current collection:

	<h4>Circular Diagrams</h4>

	These circular diagrams consist of an array of segments,
	each of them having their own start and end points,
	as well as a radius and thickness. Thickness counts to both sides of the radius,
	so to have a segment reach the center without exceeding it, give it a width equal to its radius.
	Start and end values are given in full circle units, so 1 is a whole circle.
